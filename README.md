==========

This is the repository for the FCS project. In this project, we have implemented the following:

1. The Data Encryption Standard Algorithm (DES).
2. The Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithm (AES)
3. The blowfish algorithm invented by Bruce Schneier
4. A vulnerable version of RSA.
5. Wiener's attack on this vulnerable version.

All of this has been done in Java, using the standard libraries provided. You need to have Base64 in order to run the Wiener attack on RSA.
